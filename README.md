Parkingspot_Vacancy
==============================

Finding available parking spots using a camera and machine learning.  This is my final capstone project for Springboard Data Science bootcamp course. 

I'm finishing up this project mid June and will add some nicer documentation by that point!  Here's some highlights:

* Use Mask R-CNN to detect cars occupying spots
* Deploy the app to streamlit 
* Pull a clip from a youtube live stream to check for spots, any time, unique data
* Can be easily generalized to another parking lot camera given:
    * picture/video of parking lot when it's 100% full (to identify spots)
    * Youtube URL to get a new clip from
